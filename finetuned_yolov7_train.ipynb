While the dataset is optimal for use with a classification model, it would require background augmentation for a detection algorithm like YOLO. For the background images, the GTSDB dataset was used.\n",

    "The vehicle images were filtered on the basis of vehicle diversity, sizes, angles, lighting, resolution and duplicates. It was ensured that there were equal number of images for each detection class. While the backgrounds were filtered on the basis of lighting, diversity, shots of long & open roads/highways, minimal to no leading traffic.\n",

    "1. Braking: All the images where the braking lights are on (including Braking, Braking & Turning Left, Braking & Turning Right).\n",

Although there are various tools available for this purpose, the custom code helped automate the augmentation, labelling and data splitting process. For a smaller volume dataset, manual preprocessing is recommended.\n",

    "The dataset and training needs to be enhanced to incorporate other vehicle classes such as bikes and heavy vehicles and various scenarios such as night driving, low lighting conditions and glares and disruptions. Also the detection of turn signals needs to be incorporated. The model performance on realtime data will also be tested. A lighter model can be trained and optimized for testing and deployment on edge devices. A future project might entail combining YOLO for detection and a classifier trained on this dataset for classification. The combination can be also used to generate an enhanced and annotated YOLO dataset."
